```
sudo -u postgres bash -c "psql -c\"ALTER ROLE recruitment SUPERUSER CREATEDB;\""
```

### Install bundler

```ruby

```

### Setup database

```ruby
bundle exec rails db:setup
```

### npm dependencies

Be sure that you have run the following command before you start the server:
```bash
npm install -g yarn
yarn install --check-files
```

### Running the server


The following command should be used to start the server in development mode.

- a `Question` can be either a `Mcq` or `Essay` (questionable polymorphic association)
- `Mcq` questions can take options. Each of the options support Markdown entry.
- `Mcq` questions also have `correct_options` - array indexes of the `options` that are correct.
- a `Question` can belong to multiple categories.
- an `Interview` is the question paper. You can configure the `categories` from which questions must be picked. 
- `Interview` can take additional `config` a JSON. 
- `config` currently supports

- Setup a `User`

- An `Attempt` is the actual attempt of the `Interview`. An attempt can be created for an `Interviewee` for an `Interview`
- Note that both `Attempt` and `Interview` have associated `questions` and `categories`. 
`AttemptCategories` is the subset of `InterviewCategories` that the `Interviewee` chose to answer.
